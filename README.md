# eaglercraft-vanilla1.8.8
source code found in gamersunite, folder of unobtainable, eagletcraft->clients->legit-> the one that says 1.8.8 and vanilla
the last one, 1.12 tuff client did not work. file too big to upload there so i also put 1.8.8 vanilla there what is the difference between the two version anyways, i mean, most of these public servers are 1.8.8 anyways. Dunman High, enjoy!
